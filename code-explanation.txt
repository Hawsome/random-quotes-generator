This marks the end of the HTML document.

In summary, the HTML code consists of metadata, the visible content of the webpage, and references to external CSS stylesheets and JavaScript files. It includes a header with a title and various meta tags, a body section containing the main content and a footer, and script tags for JavaScript functionality.

CSS: 

```css
html, body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}
```
This sets the margin and padding of the `html` and `body` elements to 0, effectively removing any default spacing or indentation.

```css
h1 {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
    color: #333;
    font-size: 36px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    margin: 0;
    font-family: 'Helvetica', sans-serif; /* Update the font family */
}
```
This styles the `h1` element which represents the heading of the webpage. It uses flexbox properties to vertically and horizontally center the heading. It has a height of 100 pixels, a background color of `#f2f2f2` (light gray), text color of `#333` (dark gray), font size of 36 pixels, and uses the `'Helvetica'` font family.

```css
.main-content {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    min-height: calc(100vh - 200px); /* Adjust the height based on the header and footer height */
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #fff;
}
```
This styles the `.main-content` class, which is a container for the main content of the webpage. It uses flexbox properties to vertically and horizontally center the content. The `min-height` property sets the minimum height of the container to fill the viewport height minus 200 pixels (to accommodate the header and footer). It uses the `'Arial'` font family and has a background color of `#fff` (white).

The remaining styles in the CSS code provide specific styles for different elements such as the quote container (`#quote`), author container (`#author`), generate button (`#generate`), share button (`#share`), footer (`footer`), and social icons (`social-icons`).

The CSS code also includes responsive styles using media queries. These styles adjust the font sizes and other properties for different screen sizes. There are media queries for screen widths less than or equal to 360 pixels, between 361 and 767 pixels, between 768 and 991 pixels, and between 992 and 1200 pixels.

Overall, the CSS code is responsible for the visual appearance and layout of the webpage, making it more colorful and defining the responsive behavior for different screen sizes.

JavaScript:

```javascript
// Quotes Data Source
const quotes = [
  {
    content: "It is what it is, but what it is is not what it's meant to be.",
    author: "Awesome Akinfenwa",
  },
  {
    content: "Life's Not Hard [LNH].",
    author: "Awesome Akinfenwa",
  },
  // Add more quotes here
];
```

This section defines a data source for quotes. It contains an array of quote objects, where each object has a `content` property representing the quote content and an `author` property representing the author of the quote. You can add more quotes to this array.

```javascript
let lastLocalQuote = null; // Track the last displayed local quote

// Generate Random Quote from Local Data Source
function generateLocalRandomQuote() {
  let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length);

  // Check if the randomly selected quote is the same as the last displayed local quote
  if (lastLocalQuote !== null && quotes.length > 1) {
    while (quotes[randomIndex] === lastLocalQuote) {
      randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length);
    }
  }

  const randomQuote = quotes[randomIndex];
  lastLocalQuote = randomQuote; // Update the last displayed local quote

  // Display the random quote
  document.getElementById("quote").textContent = randomQuote.content;
  document.getElementById("author").textContent = randomQuote.author;
}
```

This code defines a function `generateLocalRandomQuote()` that generates a random quote from the local data source (`quotes` array). It selects a random quote by generating a random index based on the length of the `quotes` array. If the selected quote is the same as the last displayed local quote and there is more than one quote available, it continues generating a new random index until a different quote is selected. The selected quote is then displayed on the webpage by updating the content of the `quote` and `author` elements.

```javascript
// Generate Random Quote from API
function generateAPIRandomQuote() {
  fetch("https://api.quotable.io/random")
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      document.getElementById("quote").textContent = data.content;
      document.getElementById("author").textContent = data.author;
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log("Error:", error);
    });
}
```

This code defines a function `generateAPIRandomQuote()` that generates a random quote from an external API (`https://api.quotable.io/random`). It uses the `fetch` function to make an HTTP request to the API and retrieves a random quote. The response is converted to JSON format, and the quote content and author are then displayed on the webpage.

```javascript
// Generate Random Quote
function generateRandomQuote() {
  const randomNum = Math.random();
  if (randomNum < 0.3) {
    // Generate quote from local data source
    generateLocalRandomQuote();
  } else {
    // Generate quote from API
    generateAPIRandomQuote();
  }
}
```

This code defines a function `generateRandomQuote()` that generates a random quote. It generates a random number between 0 and 1 using `Math.random()`. If the random number is less than 0.3, it calls `generateLocalRandomQuote()` to generate a quote from the local data source. Otherwise, it calls `generateAPIRandomQuote()` to generate a quote from the API.

```javascript
// Trigger Generation
document.getElementById

This code attaches a click event listener to the element with the id "generate" (presumably a button). When the button is clicked, the `generateRandomQuote()` function is called, triggering the generation of a random quote.

```javascript
// Initial Quote Generation
generateRandomQuote();
```

This line invokes the `generateRandomQuote()` function to generate an initial random quote when the page loads.

```javascript
// Share Quote
function shareQuote() {
  const quote = document.getElementById("quote").textContent;
  const author = document.getElementById("author").textContent;
  const shareText = `"${quote}" - ${author}`;

  // Create a temporary element to hold the quote text
  const tempElem = document.createElement("textarea");
  tempElem.value = shareText;
  document.body.appendChild(tempElem);
  tempElem.select();

  // Copy the quote text to the clipboard
  document.execCommand("copy");
  document.body.removeChild(tempElem);

  // Show a success message
  alert("The quote has been copied to the clipboard!");
}
```

This code defines a function `shareQuote()` that is triggered when the user clicks the element with the id "share" (presumably another button). It retrieves the quote and author from the webpage, constructs a string with the quote text and author, creates a temporary textarea element, sets its value to the constructed string, appends it to the document body, selects its contents, copies the text to the clipboard using the `execCommand("copy")` method, removes the temporary element, and displays an alert indicating that the quote has been copied to the clipboard.

```javascript
// Trigger Share
document.getElementById("share").addEventListener("click", shareQuote);
```

This code attaches a click event listener to the element with the id "share" (presumably a button). When the button is clicked, the `shareQuote()` function is called, allowing the user to share the quote.

In summary, this JavaScript code sets up a webpage where users can generate random quotes either from a local data source or an external API. The generated quote is displayed on the webpage, and users can also share the quote by copying it to the clipboard.
